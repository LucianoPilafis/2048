Tiles should maintain a consistent, fixed size during gameplay while the overall page remains responsive.\n    10\u2192\n    11\u2192**Symptoms:**\n    12\u2192- Tiles resize between moves, animations, or rerenders\n    13\u2192- Grid spacing is inconsistent; rows/columns shift\n    14\u2192- On some screen sizes, controls may be hidden or require scrolling\n    15\u2192\n    16\u2192**Expected behavior:**\n    17\u2192- Each tile maintains a constant width/height during gameplay\n    18\u2192- Grid alignment and spacing are stable\n    19\u2192- The board and controls are fully visible without scrolling on common screen sizes\n    20\u2192- The page adapts responsively to different screen sizes without breaking tile dimensions\n    21\u2192\n    22\u2192## Problem Statement\n    23\u2192The tile sizing uses `width: '100%'` and `height: '100%'` in the `Tile` component, which makes tiles inherit their size from the CSS grid parent. The grid container in `Game.tsx` uses `gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(4, 1fr)'` with a fixed `width: '340px'` and `height: '340px'`, which should provide stable cell sizes. However, the `1fr` fractional unit combined with `100%` tile dimensions and the CSS `transition: 'all 0.15s ease-in-out'` on tiles creates instability: the `all` transition keyword transitions **every** CSS property including layout-affecting properties like `width` and `height`, so any sub-pixel recalculation during a rerender triggers visible size flickering. Additionally, the fixed `340px` board size does not adapt to smaller screens (mobile), causing overflow and potential layout breaks.\n    24\u2192\n    25\u2192## Solution Statement\n    26\u2192Fix the tile size instability with two surgical changes:\n    27\u2192\n    28\u21921. **Replace fractional grid sizing with fixed pixel tile dimensions**: Change the grid from `repeat(4, 1fr)` to `repeat(4, 75px)` (fixed tile size) so each tile cell is always exactly the same size, eliminating any fractional recalculation.\n    29\u2192\n    30\u21922. **Scope the CSS transition to only visual properties**: Change `transition: 'all 0.15s ease-in-out'` to `transition: 'background-color 0.15s ease-in-out, color 0.15s ease-in-out'` so transitions only apply to color changes, not to layout properties like width/height.\n    31\u2192\n    32\u21923. **Add responsive scaling for mobile**: Use `max-width: '100%'` on the board container and a CSS `@media` query approach via inline styles to scale the board down on smaller screens without changing the actual tile pixel dimensions.\n    33\u2192\n    34\u2192## Steps to Reproduce\n    35\u21921. Open the 2048 game in a browser\n    36\u21922. Play the game by pressing arrow keys repeatedly\n    37\u21923. Observe that tiles may flicker/resize slightly between moves due to the `transition: all` property animating layout recalculations\n    38\u21924. Resize the browser window to a narrow width (< 380px)\n    39\u21925. Observe the board overflows the viewport since it has a fixed 340px width with no responsive fallback\n    40\u2192\n    41\u2192## Root Cause Analysis\n    42\u2192Two root causes:\n    43\u2192\n    44\u21921. **`transition: 'all'` on tiles** (`src/components/Tile.tsx:42`): The `all` keyword transitions every CSS property, including `width` and `height`. When React rerenders tiles (e.g., after a move), any sub-pixel layout recalculation causes `width`/`height` to animate, producing visible size flickering. This is the primary cause of tile size instability during gameplay.\n    45\u2192\n    46\u21922. **`gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(4, 1fr)'`** (`src/components/Game.tsx:70`): While `1fr` with a fixed container width should theoretically produce stable sizes, fractional units can produce sub-pixel rounding differences across browsers and rerenders. Combined with `transition: all`, even tiny size differences become visible as animated resizing.\n    47\u2192\n    48\u21923. **Fixed `340px` board with no responsive fallback** (`src/components/Game.tsx:75-76`): The board has a hardcoded pixel width that doesn't adapt to screens narrower than ~360px, causing overflow on mobile devices.\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192## Relevant Files\n    51\u2192Use these files to fix the bug:\n    52\u2192\n    53\u2192- `src/components/Tile.tsx` - Contains the Tile component with the problematic `transition: 'all'` style that causes size flickering during rerenders. The `width: '100%'` and `height: '100%'` styles inherit size from the grid parent.\n    54\u2192- `src/components/Game.tsx` - Contains the Game component with the board grid container. Uses `gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(4, 1fr)'` and fixed `width: '340px'`, `height: '340px'`. This is where grid sizing and responsive layout need to be updated.\n    55\u2192- `index.html` - Contains base CSS reset styles. May need a viewport meta tag check (already present).\n    56\u2192- `.claude/commands/test_e2e.md` - Read to understand how to create and run E2E tests.\n    57\u2192- `.claude/commands/e2e/test_basic_query.md` - Read as a reference example for E2E test file format.\n    58\u2192\n    59\u2192### New Files\n    60\u2192- `.claude/commands/e2e/test_tile_size_stability.md` - New E2E test file to validate tile size stability during gameplay and responsive layout.\n    61\u2192\n    62\u2192## Step by Step Tasks\n    63\u2192IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.\n    64\u2192\n    65\u2192### Step 1: Fix the CSS transition in Tile component\n    66\u2192- Open `src/components/Tile.tsx`\n    67\u2192- Change line 42 from `transition: 'all 0.15s ease-in-out'` to `transition: 'background-color 0.15s ease-in-out, color 0.15s ease-in-out'`\n    68\u2192- This scopes transitions to only visual properties (background-color and text color), preventing layout properties from being animated during rerenders\n    69\u2192\n    70\u2192### Step 2: Fix the grid sizing in Game component\n    71\u2192- Open `src/components/Game.tsx`\n    72\u2192- Change `gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(4, 1fr)'` to `gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(4, 75px)'`\n    73\u2192- Change `width: '340px'` to `width: 'fit-content'` so the container width is derived from the fixed tile sizes plus gap/padding rather than an independent value\n    74\u2192- Change `height: '340px'` to `height: 'fit-content'` for the same reason\n    75\u2192- Add `maxWidth: '100%'` to the grid container to prevent overflow on small screens\n    76\u2192- This ensures each tile cell is always exactly 75px x 75px, with the container fitting tightly around the grid\n    77\u2192\n    78\u2192### Step 3: Add responsive scaling to the board container\n    79\u2192- In `src/components/Game.tsx`, wrap the grid `div` in an outer container `div` if needed, or add `boxSizing: 'border-box'` to ensure padding doesn't cause overflow\n    80\u2192- Add `overflow: 'hidden'` as a safety measure on the grid wrapper to prevent any edge-case overflow\n    81\u2192- Verify the board container with `fit-content` width stays centered via the existing `alignItems: 'center'` on the parent flex container\n    82\u2192\n    83\u2192### Step 4: Create E2E test file for tile size stability\n    84\u2192- Read `.claude/commands/e2e/test_basic_query.md` and `.claude/commands/e2e/test_complex_query.md` as reference examples\n    85\u2192- Create a new E2E test file at `.claude/commands/e2e/test_tile_size_stability.md` that validates:\n    86\u2192  - Tiles render with consistent dimensions on initial load\n    87\u2192  - Tile dimensions remain stable after making moves (arrow key presses)\n    88\u2192  - Grid alignment and spacing are consistent\n    89\u2192  - The board and controls fit within the viewport without scrolling\n    90\u2192  - Take screenshots at each verification step\n    91\u2192- The test should use Playwright to measure actual tile element dimensions before and after moves and assert they match\n    92\u2192\n    93\u2192### Step 5: Run validation commands\n    94\u2192- Run all validation commands listed below to confirm the fix works with zero regressions\n    95\u2192- Verify TypeScript compilation passes\n    96\u2192- Verify the build succeeds\n    97\u2192- Run the E2E test to validate tile stability\n    98\u2192\n    99\u2192## Validation Commands\n   100\u2192Execute every command to validate the bug is fixed with zero regressions.\n   101\u2192\n   102\u2192- `npx tsc --noEmit` - Run TypeScript type checking to ensure no type errors were introduced\n   103\u2192- `npm run build` - Run the full build (tsc + vite) to validate the fix compiles and bundles correctly\n   104\u2192- Read `.claude/commands/test_e2e.md`, then read and execute the new E2E `.claude/commands/e2e/test_tile_size_stability.md` test file to validate tile size stability during gameplay and responsive layout\n   105\u2192\n   106\u2192## Notes\n   107\u2192- The fix is minimal: only two files are modified (`Tile.tsx` and `Game.tsx`) with targeted CSS changes\n   108\u2192- The 75px tile size is calculated from the original layout: (340px - 10px padding*2 - 10px gap*3) / 4 = 75px per tile, so the visual appearance remains identical\n   109\u2192- No new dependencies are needed\n   110\u2192- The `transition: all` anti-pattern is a common CSS bug that causes layout flickering in React apps since React reconciliation can trigger sub-pixel recalculations\n   111\u2192- The `fit-content` width approach is preferred over a hardcoded pixel width because it derives the container size from the actual grid content, making it more maintainable\n   112\u2192"

Tiles should maintain a consistent, fixed size during gameplay while the overall page remains responsive.\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Tiles resize between moves, animations, or rerenders\n- Grid spacing is inconsistent; rows/columns shift\n- On some screen sizes, controls may be hidden or require scrolling\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n- Each tile maintains a constant width/height during gameplay\n- Grid alignment and spacing are stable\n- The board and controls are fully visible without scrolling on common screen sizes\n- The page adapts responsively to different screen sizes without breaking tile dimensions\n\n## Problem Statement\nThe tile sizing uses `width: '100%'` and `height: '100%'` in the `Tile` component, which makes tiles inherit their size from the CSS grid parent.

May need a viewport meta tag check (already present).\n- `.claude/commands/test_e2e.md` - Read to understand how to create and run E2E tests.\n- `.claude/commands/e2e/test_basic_query.md` - Read as a reference example for E2E test file format.\n\n### New Files\n- `.claude/commands/e2e/test_tile_size_stability.md` - New E2E test file to validate tile size stability during gameplay and responsive layout.\n\n## Step by Step Tasks\nIMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.\n\n### Step 1: Fix the CSS transition in Tile component\n- Open `src/components/Tile.tsx`\n- Change line 42 from `transition: 'all 0.15s ease-in-out'` to `transition: 'background-color 0.15s ease-in-out, color 0.15s ease-in-out'`\n- This scopes transitions to only visual properties (background-color and text color), preventing layout properties from being animated during rerenders\n\n### Step 2: Fix the grid sizing in Game component\n- Open `src/components/Game.tsx`\n- Change `gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(4, 1fr)'` to `gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(4, 75px)'`\n- Change `width: '340px'` to `width: 'fit-content'` so the container width is derived from the fixed tile sizes plus gap/padding rather than an independent value\n- Change `height: '340px'` to `height: 'fit-content'` for the same reason\n- Add `maxWidth: '100%'` to the grid container to prevent overflow on small screens\n- This ensures each tile cell is always exactly 75px x 75px, with the container fitting tightly around the grid\n\n### Step 3: Add responsive scaling to the board container\n- In `src/components/Game.tsx`, wrap the grid `div` in an outer container `div` if needed, or add `boxSizing: 'border-box'` to ensure padding doesn't cause overflow\n- Add `overflow: 'hidden'` as a safety measure on the grid wrapper to prevent any edge-case overflow\n- Verify the board container with `fit-content` width stays centered via the existing `alignItems: 'center'` on the parent flex container\n\n### Step 4: Create E2E test file for tile size stability\n- Read `.claude/commands/e2e/test_basic_query.md` and `.claude/commands/e2e/test_complex_query.md` as reference examples\n- Create a new E2E test file at `.claude/commands/e2e/test_tile_size_stability.md` that validates:\n  - Tiles render with consistent dimensions on initial load\n  - Tile dimensions remain stable after making moves (arrow key presses)\n  - Grid alignment and spacing are consistent\n  - The board and controls fit within the viewport without scrolling\n  - Take screenshots at each verification step\n- The test should use Playwright to measure actual tile element dimensions before and after moves and assert they match\n\n### Step 5: Run validation commands\n- Run all validation commands listed below to confirm the fix works with zero regressions\n- Verify TypeScript compilation passes\n- Verify the build succeeds\n- Run the E2E test to validate tile stability\n\n## Validation Commands\nExecute every command to validate the bug is fixed with zero regressions.\n\n- `npx tsc --noEmit` - Run TypeScript type checking to ensure no type errors were introduced\n- `npm run build` - Run the full build (tsc + vite) to validate the fix compiles and bundles correctly\n- Read `.claude/commands/test_e2e.md`, then read and execute the new E2E `.claude/commands/e2e/test_tile_size_stability.md` test file to validate tile size stability during gameplay and responsive layout\n\n## Notes\n- The fix is minimal: only two files are modified (`Tile.tsx` and `Game.tsx`) with targeted CSS changes\n- The 75px tile size is calculated from the original layout: (340px - 10px padding*2 - 10px gap*3) / 4 = 75px per tile, so the visual appearance remains identical\n- No new dependencies are needed\n- The `transition: all` anti-pattern is a common CSS bug that causes layout flickering in React apps since React reconciliation can trigger sub-pixel recalculations\n- The `fit-content` width approach is preferred over a hardcoded pixel width because it derives the container size from the actual grid content, making it more maintainable\n",

Navigate to the `Application URL`\n2. Take a screenshot of the initial board state\n3. **Verify** the page title heading \"2048\" is visible\n4. **Verify** core UI elements are present:\n   - Game board (grid) with 16 tile cells\n   - Score display\n   - New Game button\n   - Instruction text (\"Use arrow keys to move tiles\")\n\n5. Measure the width and height of every tile cell element on the board\n6. **Verify** all tile cells have identical width (expected: 75px)\n7. **Verify** all tile cells have identical height (expected: 75px)\n8. Take a screenshot showing the measured tile dimensions\n\n9. Press the ArrowRight key to make a move\n10. Wait 300ms for any transitions to complete\n11. Measure the width and height of every tile cell element again\n12. **Verify** all tile dimensions match the dimensions measured in step 5 (no resizing after a move)\n13. Take a screenshot after the first move\n\n14. Press the ArrowDown key to make another move\n15. Wait 300ms for any transitions to complete\n16. Measure the width and height of every tile cell element again\n17. **Verify** all tile dimensions still match the original dimensions from step 5\n18. Take a screenshot after the second move\n\n19. **Verify** the board and controls (score, New Game button, instructions) are fully visible within the viewport without scrolling\n20. Take a screenshot of the full page showing all elements are visible\n\n## Success Criteria\n- All 16 tile cells render with consistent 75px x 75px dimensions on initial load\n- Tile dimensions remain exactly the same after making moves (ArrowRight, ArrowDown)\n- Grid alignment and spacing are consistent (no shifting rows/columns)\n- The board and all core controls fit within the viewport without scrolling\n- 5 screenshots are taken\n"

Navigate to the `Application URL`\n2. Take a screenshot of the initial board state\n3. **Verify** the page title heading \"2048\" is visible\n4. **Verify** core UI elements are present:\n   - Game board (grid) with 16 tile cells\n   - Score display\n   - New Game button\n   - Instruction text (\"Use arrow keys to move tiles\")\n\n5. Measure the width and height of every tile cell element on the board\n6. **Verify** all tile cells have identical width (expected: 75px)\n7. **Verify** all tile cells have identical height (expected: 75px)\n8. Take a screenshot showing the measured tile dimensions\n\n9. Press the ArrowRight key to make a move\n10. Wait 300ms for any transitions to complete\n11. Measure the width and height of every tile cell element again\n12. **Verify** all tile dimensions match the dimensions measured in step 5 (no resizing after a move)\n13. Take a screenshot after the first move\n\n14. Press the ArrowDown key to make another move\n15. Wait 300ms for any transitions to complete\n16. Measure the width and height of every tile cell element again\n17. **Verify** all tile dimensions still match the original dimensions from step 5\n18. Take a screenshot after the second move\n\n19. **Verify** the board and controls (score, New Game button, instructions) are fully visible within the viewport without scrolling\n20. Take a screenshot of the full page showing all elements are visible\n\n## Success Criteria\n- All 16 tile cells render with consistent 75px x 75px dimensions on initial load\n- Tile dimensions remain exactly the same after making moves (ArrowRight, ArrowDown)\n- Grid alignment and spacing are consistent (no shifting rows/columns)\n- The board and all core controls fit within the viewport without scrolling\n- 5 screenshots are taken\n",
