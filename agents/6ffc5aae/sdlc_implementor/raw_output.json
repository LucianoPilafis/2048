While a previous fix (PR #2, ADW `051a26d5`) addressed the `transition: all` issue and changed grid columns to `repeat(4, 75px)`, the tiles still lack an explicit **row height**. The grid has `gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(4, 75px)'` but no `gridTemplateRows` or `gridAutoRows`, so row height is determined by content (the text inside each tile). This means:\n    10\u2192\n    11\u2192- Empty tiles (value `null`) render with zero or minimal height since they have no text content, causing rows to collapse\n    12\u2192- Tiles with different font sizes (the `fontSize` changes at value > 1024) cause row height to shift\n    13\u2192- The `height: '100%'` on the Tile component resolves to the content-driven row height, not to an explicit 75px\n    14\u2192\n    15\u2192**Symptoms:**\n    16\u2192- Tile rows may have inconsistent heights depending on content\n    17\u2192- Empty tiles collapse or have minimal height\n    18\u2192- Grid looks unstable when tiles appear/disappear during moves\n    19\u2192- The grid height is not predictable because rows are content-sized\n    20\u2192\n    21\u2192**Expected behavior:**\n    22\u2192- Every tile cell is exactly 75px x 75px regardless of content\n    23\u2192- Empty and filled tiles have identical dimensions\n    24\u2192- Grid maintains a stable, predictable layout at all times\n    25\u2192\n    26\u2192## Problem Statement\n    27\u2192The grid rows have no explicit height definition. While columns are fixed at 75px via `gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(4, 75px)'`, rows default to `auto` sizing which makes their height depend on content. Combined with `height: '100%'` on tiles (which resolves to the content-driven auto height), this creates instability when tile content changes between moves.\n    28\u2192\n    29\u2192## Solution Statement\n    30\u2192Add `gridAutoRows: '75px'` to the grid container in `Game.tsx` to give every row a fixed 75px height, matching the column width. This ensures each grid cell is exactly 75px x 75px regardless of content. The Tile component's `width: '100%'` and `height: '100%'` will then correctly resolve to 75px x 75px from the fixed grid cell dimensions.\n    31\u2192\n    32\u2192## Steps to Reproduce\n    33\u21921. Open the 2048 game in a browser\n    34\u21922. Inspect the grid tiles using browser dev tools\n    35\u21923. Observe that tile row heights depend on content \u2014 empty rows may collapse or have inconsistent heights\n    36\u21924. Play several moves and observe grid height may shift slightly as tiles with different content (or empty tiles) appear in different rows\n    37\u21925. Especially noticeable when a row transitions from having all filled tiles to having empty tiles\n    38\u2192\n    39\u2192## Root Cause Analysis\n    40\u2192The grid container in `src/components/Game.tsx` defines fixed column widths via `gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(4, 75px)'` but does not define row heights. CSS Grid defaults rows to `auto` height, which sizes them to fit their content. Since tiles use `height: '100%'` (inheriting from the auto-sized row), the actual rendered height depends on:\n    41\u2192- Whether the tile has text content (null vs number)\n    42\u2192- The font size of the content (which changes at value > 1024)\n    43\u2192\n    44\u2192Adding `gridAutoRows: '75px'` explicitly sets every row to 75px, making each grid cell a fixed 75x75 square regardless of content.\n    45\u2192\n    46\u2192## Relevant Files\n    47\u2192Use these files to fix the bug:\n    48\u2192\n    49\u2192- `src/components/Game.tsx` - Contains the board grid container. Missing `gridAutoRows` property to fix row height. This is the only file that needs modification.\n    50\u2192- `src/components/Tile.tsx` - Contains the Tile component. Uses `width: '100%'` and `height: '100%'` which will correctly resolve to 75x75 once the grid rows are fixed.

Navigate to the `Application URL`\n2. Take a screenshot of the initial board state\n3. **Verify** the page title heading \"2048\" is visible\n4. **Verify** core UI elements are present:\n   - Game board (grid) with 16 tile cells\n   - Score display\n   - New Game button\n   - Instruction text (\"Use arrow keys to move tiles\")\n\n5. Measure the width and height of every tile cell element on the board\n6. **Verify** all tile cells have identical width (expected: 75px)\n7. **Verify** all tile cells have identical height (expected: 75px)\n8. Take a screenshot showing the measured tile dimensions\n\n9. Press the ArrowRight key to make a move\n10. Wait 300ms for any transitions to complete\n11. Measure the width and height of every tile cell element again\n12. **Verify** all tile dimensions match the dimensions measured in step 5 (no resizing after a move)\n13. Take a screenshot after the first move\n\n14. Press the ArrowDown key to make another move\n15. Wait 300ms for any transitions to complete\n16. Measure the width and height of every tile cell element again\n17. **Verify** all tile dimensions still match the original dimensions from step 5\n18. Take a screenshot after the second move\n\n19. **Verify** the board and controls (score, New Game button, instructions) are fully visible within the viewport without scrolling\n20. Take a screenshot of the full page showing all elements are visible\n\n## Success Criteria\n- All 16 tile cells render with consistent 75px x 75px dimensions on initial load\n- Tile dimensions remain exactly the same after making moves (ArrowRight, ArrowDown)\n- Grid alignment and spacing are consistent (no shifting rows/columns)\n- The board and all core controls fit within the viewport without scrolling\n- 5 screenshots are taken\n",

Navigate to the `Application URL`\n2. Take a screenshot of the initial board state\n3. **Verify** the page title heading \"2048\" is visible\n4. **Verify** core UI elements are present:\n   - Game board (grid) with 16 tile cells\n   - Score display\n   - New Game button\n   - Instruction text (\"Use arrow keys to move tiles\")\n\n5. Measure the width and height of every tile cell element on the board\n6. **Verify** all tile cells have identical width (expected: 75px)\n7. **Verify** all tile cells have identical height (expected: 75px)\n8. Take a screenshot showing the measured tile dimensions\n\n9. Press the ArrowRight key to make a move\n10. Wait 300ms for any transitions to complete\n11. Measure the width and height of every tile cell element again\n12. **Verify** all tile dimensions match the dimensions measured in step 5 (no resizing after a move)\n13. Take a screenshot after the first move\n\n14. Press the ArrowDown key to make another move\n15. Wait 300ms for any transitions to complete\n16. Measure the width and height of every tile cell element again\n17. **Verify** all tile dimensions still match the original dimensions from step 5\n18. Take a screenshot after the second move\n\n19. **Verify** the board and controls (score, New Game button, instructions) are fully visible within the viewport without scrolling\n20. Take a screenshot of the full page showing all elements are visible\n\n## Success Criteria\n- All 16 tile cells render with consistent 75px x 75px dimensions on initial load\n- Tile dimensions remain exactly the same after making moves (ArrowRight, ArrowDown)\n- Grid alignment and spacing are consistent (no shifting rows/columns)\n- The board and all core controls fit within the viewport without scrolling\n- 5 screenshots are taken\n"

The issue is that React renders inline styles as individual CSS properties (e.g., `style=\"display: grid;\"` becomes multiple style properties), so the `[style*=\"display: grid\"]` selector might not match exactly. Let me update the test to use a more robust approach - find the grid container by its structural characteristics."
