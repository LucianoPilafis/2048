/bug 3 1be417b6 {"number":3,"title":"Keep 4x4 board tiles fixed: prevent tile resizing and shifting","body":"Description\nThe 4x4 game board tiles (squares) are changing size and/or shifting, which makes the board look unstable. Fix the UI so the board is always a 4x4 grid and every tile keeps the same consistent square size during gameplay and across re-renders.\n\nAcceptance criteria\n\nThe board always renders as a 4x4 grid.\n\nAll tiles are perfect squares and remain the same width/height at all times (no resizing between moves or re-renders).\n\nRows/columns stay aligned and spacing between tiles remains consistent (no shifting/jumping).\n\nWorks correctly across common screen sizes (desktop + mobile) without breaking the board layout."}
