Update the UI so the tiles keep a consistent, fixed size during gameplay and across re-renders, while the overall page remains responsive to the user\u2019s screen and does not overflow (no hidden controls or forced scrolling).\\n\\nAcceptance criteria\\n\\nTile size is stable: each board tile keeps the same width/height during gameplay (no resizing between moves, animations, or rerenders).\\n\\nGrid alignment is stable: spacing between tiles is consistent and rows/columns do not shift.\\n\\nThe UI fits the screen: the board and core controls are visible without needing to scroll on common desktop and mobile screen sizes.\\n\\nResponsive layout is maintained: the page adapts to different screen sizes without layout breaks or unexpected tile resizing.\"} specs/issue-1-adw-051a26d5-sdlc_planner-fix-tile-size-stability.md 051a26d5"
