Fix the UI so the board is always a 4x4 grid and every tile keeps the same consistent square size during gameplay and across re-renders.\\n\\nAcceptance criteria\\n\\nThe board always renders as a 4x4 grid.\\n\\nAll tiles are perfect squares and remain the same width/height at all times (no resizing between moves or re-renders).\\n\\nRows/columns stay aligned and spacing between tiles remains consistent (no shifting/jumping).\\n\\nWorks correctly across common screen sizes (desktop + mobile) without breaking the board layout.\"} specs/issue-3-adw-1be417b6-sdlc_planner-fix-tile-size-stability.md 1be417b6"
